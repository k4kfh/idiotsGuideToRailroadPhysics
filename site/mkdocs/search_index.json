            "text": "Introduction to Simulation Physics\n#\n\n\nThe backbone of train simulation physics is the simple equation, \nF=MA\n (\nForce = Mass x Acceleration\n). Acceleration is a measure of how quickly you are gaining or losing speed. \nRead more on accceleration here.\n\n\nWe want to find the acceleration of the train, and we can use algebra to rearrange \nF=MA\n, making it \nAcceleration = Force/Mass\n. So to find the acceleration (and thus the speed) we need to know the force acting on the train and  the mass of the train. The mass is easy to find. The force...not so much.\n\n\n\n\nNot familiar with F=MA?\n\n\nIf you are not already familiar with the basics of F=MA, please \nread more on that here.\n There are some excellent practice problems to get you comfortable with Newton's second law on that page as well.\n\n\n\n\nHorsepower\n#\n\n\nHorsepower is an interesting concept. We know that the F7-A has a 1500HP motor, but what can we do with that number?\n\n\nOne \nHorsepower\n is equal to 550 foot-pounds per second. This means that one horsepower could lift 550 pounds by 1 foot in 1 second. This can also be represented as approximately 745.7 watts.\n\n\nImportant Concept:\n On a diesel locomotive, you are not always outputting the maximum horsepower. It is roughly proportional to throttle position, so we can estimate the output horsepower like this:\n\n\nOutput Horsepower = (Throttle Position/8) * Maximum\n\n\n\n\nSo for an F7 with the throttle in RUN1, the math would look like this:\n\n\n187.5 HP = (1/8) * 1500HP\n\n\n\n\nAnd it looks like, from this, we could convert horsepower to foot-lbs and be all done, right? \n187.5 * 550 = 10,3125 foot-pounds per second\n, right?\n\n\nNo, not exactly.\n\n\nBecause of the complex machinery generating this force, the output force at the wheels is not linearly proportional to the throttle position. We'll cover more on this later, but it has to do with the properties of electric motors (such as our traction motors), and specifically \nBack-EMF.\n\n\nWhat is Tractive Effort?\n#\n\n\nOn a locomotive, the linear output force (how hard it pulls) is called \ntractive effort\n. Because of how \nBack-EMF\n affects electric motors, the faster a motor spins, the less current it draws, and consequently, the less force it outputs. The specifics behind this decline in \ntractive effort\n get very complex, but the principle is simple:\n\n\nThe higher your speed, the lower your locomotive's tractive effort.\n\n\nThis decline is not linear; \nit happens in an exponential curve.\n\n\nWith this in mind, there are two places we can get tractive effort:\n\n\n\n\nStarting Tractive Effort\n, found in the locomotive data sheet, is the rated tractive effort starting from a standstill in RUN8. On the F7, this is 56,500lbs.\n\n\nThe Tractive Effort estimation formula,\n which I found in a paper from Virginia Tech University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTractive Effort Estimation Formula\n#\n\n\nI do not take credit for this excellent formula. I found it in \na paper by Virginia Tech on Rail Resistance Equations.\n It is located on page 11.\n\n\n\n\nT=2650\\frac{nP}{V}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n is Tractive Effort, in Newtons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n is Horsepower. Remember, the output horsepower, not the maximum horsepower!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n is the velocity (aka speed) in km/hr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n is the locomotive's efficiency in converting power output to tractive effort. For the F7, I found ~0.72 is best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might wonder...how accurate is this?\n\n\nFor the F7, within 0.75%.\n\n\nThe other way that you could find tractive effort, of course, is by using a table of measured values, however these are hard to find for many locomotives. I tested this equation against a known table of values for the EMD F7, and by tuning the efficiency coefficient (n) I was able to get an average percent error of 0.33%. I deemed this acceptable, so this guide will be using this formula for tractive effort unless a better method comes along.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I use this formula?\n#\n\n\n1. Find your locomotive's starting tractive effort. This is available in most locomotive data sheets.\n For the F7, this is 56,500lbs.\n\n\n2. Find a \"Continuous Tractive Effort\" rating for your locomotive.\n You may find multiple ratings for a variety of different speeds. Pick one. For the F7, the data sheet says 40,000 lbs @ 9.3 mph.\n\n\n3. Convert that rating to metric units.\n This converts to 177928.86 Newtons @ 14.9669 km/hr.\n\n\n4. Input this speed into the formula,\n using your maximum horsepower as \nP\n. Use 0.85 for your efficiency coefficient. For the F7, that looks like this:\n\nT=2650\\frac{0.85 * 1500}{14.9669}\n\nWhen we work that out, \nT = 225748.1509 Newtons\n.\n\n5. Convert your calculated tractive effort value to pounds.\n I'm lazy, so I use Google's built-in converter. 225748.1509 Newtons converts to about 50,750 lbs.\n\n\n6. Compare this calculated value to the measured value from your data sheet.\n In my case, I calculated 50,750lbs, but the measured value is 40,000lbs. So this means my efficiency coefficient of 0.85 was too high. The locomotive is not 85% efficient, it is less than that. We can tell because we got 10,750lbs more tractive effort than we should have.\n\n\n7. Tune your efficiency coefficient.\n This will take some fiddling, so I highly recommend creating a spreadsheet to do the math for you. If your calculated value was too high, lower your efficiency coefficient. If your calculated value was too low, raise your efficiency coefficient. For the F7, I found that the optimal efficiency is 72%, which sets the efficiency coefficient at 0.72.\n\n\n8. Double check your work.\n If we work the same math with the new 0.72 efficiency, we get this:\n\n191221.9631=2650\\frac{0.72 * 1500}{14.9669}\n\nConvert 191221.9631 Newtons to pounds and we are left with about 42,988lbs. This is much closer to the rated value of 40,000lbs, so this coefficient works.\n\n\n9. Test the coefficient with other speeds.\n You might be able to find another rating for your locomotive (at a different speed). Test the same coefficient at that speed, and see how close you are. This is where a spreadsheet can come in handy, because you can adjust the efficiency coefficient and see instantly how it affects your tractive effort values. I have created an example spreadsheet on Google Docs, which is available \nhere.\n You can also make your own spreadsheet, and I have included a tractive effort table for the F7 at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n10. Find the speed where the equation returns a lower value than your starting tractive effort.\n For the first 5-10 miles per hour, you need to just use the starting tractive effort and ignore the equation. The speed where the equation matches the starting tractive effort is the speed where you start using the equation. For the F7, this is 8.9mph, but if you're using another locomotive you'll have to find it.\n\n\nOnce you've found the speed where the equation starts, as well as tuned the efficiency coefficient to match the measured values, you can use the equation to find the tractive effort for any throttle position, not just the max horsepower output (RUN8).\n\n\nExamples\n#\n\n\n\n\n1. An F7 is moving at 10.2mph, and is in RUN2. Find the tractive effort.\n\n\n10.2mph = 16.41531km/hr\n\n\n1500HP * 2/8 will be our horsepower. The 2/8 is because we're in RUN2 out of 8.\n\n\n\n\nT=2650\\frac{0.72 * (1500 * \\frac{2}{8})}{16.41531}\n\n\n\n\nSo T equals approximately 39,193lbs.\n\n\n\n\n2. An F7 is moving at 40mph, and is in RUN6. Find the tractive effort.\n\n\n40mph = 64.3738 km/hr\n\n\n1500HP * 6/8 = 1125HP\n\n\n\n\nT=2650\\frac{0.72 * 1125}{64.3738}\n\n\n\n\nSo T equals approximately 7,496lbs.\n\n\nSee how much tractive effort you lose with speed?\n\n\n\n\nF7 Tractive Effort Table\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\nTractive Effort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 (Starting) through 8.8mph\n\n\n56,500lbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.9mph\n\n\n45,000lbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.4mph\n\n\n30,000lbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15mph\n\n\n26,786lbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25mph\n\n\n16,035lbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30mph\n\n\n13,363lbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40mph\n\n\n10,021lbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60mph\n\n\n6,681lbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's all for this chapter.

This decline is not linear;  it happens in an exponential curve.  With this in mind, there are two places we can get tractive effort:   Starting Tractive Effort , found in the locomotive data sheet, is the rated tractive effort starting from a standstill in RUN8. On the F7, this is 56,500lbs.  The Tractive Effort estimation formula,  which I found in a paper from Virginia Tech University.",

T=2650\\frac{nP}{V}     T  is Tractive Effort, in Newtons.    P  is Horsepower. Remember, the output horsepower, not the maximum horsepower!    V  is the velocity (aka speed) in km/hr.    n  is the locomotive's efficiency in converting power output to tractive effort. For the F7, I found ~0.72 is best.     You might wonder...how accurate is this?  For the F7, within 0.75%.  The other way that you could find tractive effort, of course, is by using a table of measured values, however these are hard to find for many locomotives. I tested this equation against a known table of values for the EMD F7, and by tuning the efficiency coefficient (n) I was able to get an average percent error of 0.33%. I deemed this acceptable, so this guide will be using this formula for tractive effort unless a better method comes along.",

            "text": "1. Find your locomotive's starting tractive effort. This is available in most locomotive data sheets.  For the F7, this is 56,500lbs.  2. Find a \"Continuous Tractive Effort\" rating for your locomotive.  You may find multiple ratings for a variety of different speeds. Pick one. For the F7, the data sheet says 40,000 lbs @ 9.3 mph.  3. Convert that rating to metric units.  This converts to 177928.86 Newtons @ 14.9669 km/hr.  4. Input this speed into the formula,  using your maximum horsepower as  P . Use 0.85 for your efficiency coefficient. For the F7, that looks like this: T=2650\\frac{0.85 * 1500}{14.9669} \nWhen we work that out,  T = 225748.1509 Newtons . 5. Convert your calculated tractive effort value to pounds.  I'm lazy, so I use Google's built-in converter. 225748.1509 Newtons converts to about 50,750 lbs.  6. Compare this calculated value to the measured value from your data sheet.  In my case, I calculated 50,750lbs, but the measured value is 40,000lbs. So this means my efficiency coefficient of 0.85 was too high. The locomotive is not 85% efficient, it is less than that. We can tell because we got 10,750lbs more tractive effort than we should have.  7. Tune your efficiency coefficient.  This will take some fiddling, so I highly recommend creating a spreadsheet to do the math for you. If your calculated value was too high, lower your efficiency coefficient. If your calculated value was too low, raise your efficiency coefficient. For the F7, I found that the optimal efficiency is 72%, which sets the efficiency coefficient at 0.72.  8. Double check your work.  If we work the same math with the new 0.72 efficiency, we get this: 191221.9631=2650\\frac{0.72 * 1500}{14.9669} \nConvert 191221.9631 Newtons to pounds and we are left with about 42,988lbs. This is much closer to the rated value of 40,000lbs, so this coefficient works.  9. Test the coefficient with other speeds.  You might be able to find another rating for your locomotive (at a different speed). Test the same coefficient at that speed, and see how close you are. This is where a spreadsheet can come in handy, because you can adjust the efficiency coefficient and see instantly how it affects your tractive effort values. I have created an example spreadsheet on Google Docs, which is available  here.  You can also make your own spreadsheet, and I have included a tractive effort table for the F7 at the bottom of the page.  10. Find the speed where the equation returns a lower value than your starting tractive effort.  For the first 5-10 miles per hour, you need to just use the starting tractive effort and ignore the equation. The speed where the equation matches the starting tractive effort is the speed where you start using the equation. For the F7, this is 8.9mph, but if you're using another locomotive you'll have to find it.  Once you've found the speed where the equation starts, as well as tuned the efficiency coefficient to match the measured values, you can use the equation to find the tractive effort for any throttle position, not just the max horsepower output (RUN8).",

While the tractive effort formula above will give (decreasing) force constantly as speed increases, eventually the electric motors reach the maximum RPM for a given voltage. So for example, an F7 in RUN8 typically has a maximum speed of around 60mph. This is similar to a car; at a given throttle (gas pedal) level, without shifting gears, there is only so fast your engine can turn, and thus there is only so fast your car can move. Traction motors have a similar property, it's just related to the voltage of the electricity used to run them (which is from the generator turned by the prime mover) rather than mechanical limits of a combustion engine.\n\n\nQuirk #2 - Gear Ratio\n#\n\n\nOkay, I didn't tell you the whole story in the last paragraph. Traction motors do have a finite RPM limit, but the resulting speed limit for the locomotive is also dependent on the gear ratio. The typical gear ratio for an EMD F7 is 62:15, meaning the axle gear has 62 teeth and the motor gear has 15 teeth. But there \nwere\n other gear ratios sold by EMD, to offer more speed at the cost of power, or more power at the cost of speed. This has to do with gear reduction, and it will affect the maximum speed at a given notch.\n\n\nMath for the Quirks\n#\n\n\nMaximum speed for a given gear ratio, in my experience, is just something you have to look up. Finding a data sheet, \nlike this one for the F7,\n will often tell you. If you can't find it there, try to find a PDF of the locomotive's manual, like \nthis, also for the F7.\n\n\nOnce you have the \nmaximum\n maximum speed, you can approximate the maximum speed for a given notch with some simple multiplication.\n\n\nMaxSpeed = Absolute Max Speed * (Current Notch / 8)\n\n\n\n\nSo an example for an F7 in RUN3 would be:\n\n\nMaxSpeed = 65mph * (3 / 8)\n         = 24.375mph\n\n\n\n\nThere are probably more accurate methods for this, but simple multiplication will get the job done. If you're really adventurous, you could use an RPM table for different throttle positions on a given prime mover, and do some math with that. But that's more advanced than I'll get into here.\n\n\n\n\nRolling Resistance\n#\n\n\nAll rolling objects have a natural resistance to rolling. This is called (uncreatively) \nrolling resistance\n.\n\n\nRolling resistance is constant, so it's very simple to calculate:\n\n\nRolling Resistance = (Coefficient of Rolling Resistance) * (Weight of the Object)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Coefficients of Rolling Resistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.001 - 0.002\n\n\nrailroad steel wheels on steel rails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.001\n\n\nbicycle tire on wooden track\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.004\n\n\nbicycle tire on asphalt road\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.02\n\n\ncar tires on asphalt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.04 - 0.08\n\n\ncar tires on loose gravel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're dealing with American trains, chances are you already have the locomotive's weight (in pounds). If you happen to be working in SI units (grams) then you can convert to Newtons (the SI unit of force) by multiplying your object's mass by 9.8 m/sec^2, the acceleration of Earth's gravity.\n\n\nExample #1: EMD F7\n#\n\n\nThe EMD F7-A weighs 230,000lbs. We know from the table above that the coefficient of rolling resistance for steel wheels on steel rails is around 0.0015. So let's do the math:\n\n\nRolling Resistance = 0.0015 * 230,000lbs\n                   = 345lbs\n\n\n\n\nSo at \nany\n speed, a force of 345lbs is acting to stop the rolling of an EMD F7-A.\n\n\nExample #2: Loaded Boxcar\n#\n\n\nAccording to \nUnion Pacific\n, the total weight of a loaded boxcar is between 263,000 and 286,000lbs. Let's assume ours is in the middle and weighs 270,000lbs. The boxcar has steel wheels, and will roll on steel rail, so again we'll use 0.0015 as the coefficient of rolling resistance.\n\n\nRolling Resistance = 0.0015 * 270,000lbs\n                   = 405lbs\n\n\n\n\nSo at any speed, a loaded Union Pacific boxcar has a force of 405lbs acting to slow down/stop it.\n\n\n\n\nGrade Forces\n#\n\n\nUp until this point, we've been assuming that trains all operate on perfectly flat, level track. Of course we know that's not the case. There are hills all over the place in the real world. So how do we account for that?\n\n\nSimple: \nFor every ton of train weight on a 1% grade a force of 20 pounds is acting to roll the train down the hill.\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Al Krug\n\n\nSo for a 1% grade, convert your train weight to tons (2000lbs = 1 ton) and multiply by 20. For other grades, use the following logic:\n\n\nFor every ton of train weight on a 1% grade, a force of 20 pounds is acting to roll the train down the hill. Therefore, for every ton of train weight on a 2% grade, a force of \n40lbs\n is acting to roll the train down the hill.\n\n\nUsing the logic/math above, you can calculate the pull of a grade on any train just by knowing the train's weight and the grade it's on (1%, 2%, etc).\n\n\n\n\nThat's all for this page, in the next chapter I'll discuss summing up these forces to find acceleration/speed of the train.",
