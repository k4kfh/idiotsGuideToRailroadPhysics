### Introduction

This page serves half of this entire guide's purpose. As I said in the author's note at the beginning, one of my goals with this guide is to make hard-to-find numbers/formulas easy to find. I've spent countless hours searching for obscure formulas, reservoir dimensions, pipe diameters, operating pressures, and other important numbers that nobody seems to have. Consequently, I've gathered all of these values in one central location to save everyone else the trouble.

## Formulas

- **Tractive Effort:** T = 2650 * (nP/V)
	- Where T is Tractive Effort in Newtons 
	- n is an efficiency coefficient (for the F7-A it is ~.85)
	- P is the output horsepower
	- V is the velocity in km/hr 
	

## Numbers

- **Main Air Reservoir Volume**
	- EMD F7-A : 46.7882 cubic feet
- **Main Air Reservoir, Compressor Cutoff Switch Pressures (Typical)**
	- Upper Limit: 140psi
	- Lower Limit: 130psi
- **Train Brake Pipe Pressure (Typical)**
	- 90psi to 120psi
